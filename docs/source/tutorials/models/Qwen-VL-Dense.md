# Qwen-VL-Dense(Qwen3-VL-2B/4B/8B/32B)

## 1 Introduction

The Qwen-VL(Vision-Language)series from Alibaba Cloud comprises a family of powerful Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) designed for comprehensive multimodal understanding. They accept images, text, and bounding boxes as input, and output text and detection boxes, enabling advanced functions like image detection, multi-modal dialogue, and multi-image reasoning.

This document will show the main verification steps of the model, including supported features, feature configuration, environment preparation, NPU deployment, accuracy and performance evaluation.

This tutorial uses the vLLM-Ascend `v0.11.0rc3-a3` version for demonstration, showcasing the `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` model as an example for single NPU and multi-NPU deployment.

## 4 Installation

### 4.1 Docker Image Installation

Select an image based on your machine type and start the docker image on your node, refer to [using docker](../../installation.md#set-up-using-docker).

**A3 series:**

Start the docker image on each node.

``` bash
# Update the vllm-ascend image
export IMAGE=quay.io/ascend/vllm-ascend:{{ vllm_ascend_version }}

docker run --rm \
--name vllm-ascend \
--shm-size=1g \
--device /dev/davinci0 \
--device /dev/davinci_manager \
--device /dev/devmm_svm \
--device /dev/hisi_hdc \
-v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
-v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
-v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
-v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
-v /root/.cache:/root/.cache \
-p 8000:8000 \
-it $IMAGE bash
```

**Installation Verification:**

After starting the container, run the following command to verify the installation:

```bash
docker ps | grep vllm-ascend
```

Expected result: The container is listed with status `Up`. You can also verify the vllm-ascend version inside the container:

```bash
pip show vllm-ascend
```

Expected result: The version information is displayed, matching the pulled image version.

### 4.2 Source Code Installation

If you prefer not to use the Docker image, you can build from source. Install vLLM from source first:

1. Clone and install vLLM:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
   cd vllm
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Clone and install the vLLM-Ascend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend.git
   cd vllm-ascend
   pip install -e .
   ```

**Installation Verification:**

```bash
pip show vllm vllm-ascend
```

Expected result: The version information for both packages is displayed, confirming a successful installation.

!!! note

    If deploying a multi-node environment, set up the environment on each node.

For more details, please refer to the [Installation Guide](../../installation.md).

## 5 Online Service Deployment

### 5.1 Single-Node Online Deployment

Run docker container to start the vLLM server on single-NPU:

``` bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct \
--dtype bfloat16 \
--max_model_len 16384 \
--max-num-batched-tokens 16384
```

Key Parameter Descriptions:

- Add `--max_model_len` option to avoid ValueError that the Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct model's max seq len (256000) is larger than the maximum number of tokens that can be stored in KV cache. This will differ with different NPU series based on the on-chip memory size. Please modify the value according to a suitable value for your NPU series.

If your service start successfully, you can see the info shown below:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [2736]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## 6 Functional Verification

Once your server is started, you can query the model with input prompts:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/resource/qwen.png"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is the text in the illustration?"}
    ]}
    ]
    }'
```

Expected Result:

The service returns HTTP 200 OK.

```bash
{"id":"chatcmpl-d3270d4a16cb4b98936f71ee3016451f","object":"chat.completion","created":1764924127,"model":"Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"The text in the illustration is: **TONGYI Qwen**","refusal":null,"annotations":null,"audio":null,"function_call":null,"tool_calls":[],"reasoning_content":null},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop","stop_reason":null,"token_ids":null}],"service_tier":null,"system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"prompt_tokens":107,"total_tokens":123,"completion_tokens":16,"prompt_tokens_details":null},"prompt_logprobs":null,"prompt_token_ids":null,"kv_transfer_params":null}
```

## 7 Accuracy Evaluation

### Using Language Model Evaluation Harness

The accuracy of some models is already within our CI monitoring scope, including:

- `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct`

As an example, take the `mmmu_val` dataset as a test dataset, and run accuracy evaluation of `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` in offline mode.

1. Refer to [Using lm_eval](../../developer_guide/evaluation/using_lm_eval.md) for more details on `lm_eval` installation.

    ```shell
    pip install lm_eval
    ```

2. Run `lm_eval` to execute the accuracy evaluation.

    ```shell
    lm_eval \
        --model vllm-vlm \
        --model_args pretrained=Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct,max_model_len=8192,gpu_memory_utilization=0.7 \
        --tasks mmmu_val \
        --batch_size 32 \
        --apply_chat_template \
        --trust_remote_code \
        --output_path ./results
    ```

3. After execution, you can get the result, here is the result of `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` in `vllm-ascend:0.11.0rc3` for reference only.

    |  Tasks  |Value |Stderr|
    |---------|---|-----|
    |mmmu_val |0.5389|0.0159|

## 8 Performance Evaluation

### Using vLLM Benchmark

Refer to [vLLM Benchmark](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/benchmarking/) for more details.

There are three `vllm bench` subcommands:

- `latency`: Benchmark the latency of a single batch of requests.
- `serve`: Benchmark the online serving throughput.
- `throughput`: Benchmark offline inference throughput.

The performance evaluation must be conducted in an online mode. Take the `serve` as an example. Run the code as follows.

```shell
vllm bench serve --model Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct  --dataset-name random --random-input 200 --num-prompts 200 --request-rate 1 --save-result --result-dir ./
```

After about several minutes, you can get the performance evaluation result.
